      <p>

This agreement outlines the terms and conditions under which you, the Licensee, may use the Malkmusl&apos;s software, developed and owned by Lucas Malkmus (malkmusl).

      <h3 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Version and Revision Explanation</h3>
      <p>
        In this context, the term &quot;Version&quot; refers to incremental updates and additions made to the license text, allowing for the inclusion of new terms or modifications to existing ones. This enables us to adapt the license to changing circumstances and licensing practices while ensuring clarity and relevance over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conversely, the term &quot;Revision&quot; is utilized solely to update the copyright information within the license, ensuring compliance with legal requirements and acknowledging the contributions of various contributors to the licensed software.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is crucial to note that the Revision may differ from one project to another, as each project may have unique requirements, contributors, and collaborative dynamics. By maintaining this distinction between Version and Revision, we can foster a flexible licensing approach that accommodates diverse projects while upholding proper copyright management across all endeavors.
      </p>
      <p>
        When this License undergoes sub-version updates, such as 1.0 to 1.1, 1.2 to 1.3, and others, you will find those changes presented in a clear and organized manner within this file, enhancing readability. However, please note that the version history for this file will be cleared when a major update, like 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc., occurs. For the full and comprehensive list of all changes, including major updates, we recommend visiting our website: malkmusl.cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Please exercise caution while using the early stages of this license. A more stable version of this license is anticipated with the arrival of the first major update to version 2.0. We appreciate your understanding and look forward to providing you with an enhanced experience soon.</strong>
